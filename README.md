# Docucrunch (Document Summariser Application)

## Project overview 

DocuCrunch is a web app that enables users to upload PDF documents or paste raw text in order to receive a summarised version. 

The app leverages two AI models:

- A121: used for summarising articles
- Hugging Face model : used for summarising meeting minutes

## Project structure 
**Front-end**:  Developed in React.
  - Handles user interaction, PDF upload, and displays summarised text.
     
**Back-end**: Developed in Spring Boot and Python.
  - Provides REST API endpoints for text extraction and summarisation.
  - Makes API calls to the AI models (A121 and Hugging Face)

## AI Models Configuration

The models are configured in the service layer and can be adjusted according to the specific use case. The models require authentication tokens, which are stored in the application.properties file. Users must provide their own tokens by updating the relevant properties in this file before running the application.
